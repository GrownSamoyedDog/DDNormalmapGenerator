# DD Heightmap to Normalmap Generator / Converter
A Tool for my upcoming game DD.

Converts 2-tone Black and White tilesheets to normalmaps.
Crudely implemented and slow as sin.

Public, because it may have some utility to others who wish to generate remedial pixel normalmaps.
I do not recommend using this unless I have linked you here because of how remedial and specific it is.
